# Higher or Lower Solitaire Game
It's a simple guessing game made with Java Swing where the user tries to get through the whole deck by guessing whether the next card will be higher or lower. 

My friends and I used to play this to pass time, now I can do the same without a deck of cards and a large amount of table space.
