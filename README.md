# High-Low Solitaire Game
I built this based on a game my frineds and I used to play to pass time in class.

It's a simple guessing game, and although the concept is easy to grasp, 
the luck involved makes it hard to win.  

## How to Use
Download the files and run the Main java file. Gameplay instructions are in the program.
